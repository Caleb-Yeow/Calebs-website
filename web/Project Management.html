              For the Development of my website, i had to learn how to firstly use HTML. To start of, i had utilised the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk">Learn HTML in 12 mins video</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ13lX20FqU">learn more HTML in 20 mins video</a> both from the youtube chanel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc1Pn7FxieMohCZFPYEbs7w">Jake Wright</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools website</a> as a baseline reference to ensure that the codes that I had input were correct and that it was able to run smoothly for a base website. 
         </p>
         
         <img src="images/basic%20HTML%20format.png" width="240" height="135"/>     <img src="images/MyHTML.png" width="240" height="135"/>
         
        <p>
         To go into more detail, i have learned about the format of "DOCTYPE" Html, how to include videos and pictures through commands like "img src" and "href" to include videos or website links. "div" to identify the portions of the website and headers to visually markout the main content of my webpage.
    
         
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
             For the visual aesthetic and the formatting of the website, I had to learn how to use CSS. Firstly, I had refered to the youtube video "learn CSS in 12 mins" before actually starting the process of improving the looks of my website, this was because CSS was alot more confusing to me and that it had a higher difficultly as compared to HTML, it required to accurately space out the pixels of the website so that it produces a nicer finish to the website, and then also using the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools website</a> for references to certain codes.
